# DirStarter - Next.js Directory Boilerplate

DirStarter is a complete Next.js boilerplate for building profitable directory websites. Make money from day one with our battle-tested stack and built-in monetization features.

## Author

This project is created by [Piotr Kulpinski](https://kulpinski.dev), the founder of [OpenAlternative](https://openalternative.co), [DevSuite](https://devsuite.co) and other directory websites. This boilerplate is the fruit of years of trial and error, and I'm sharing it with you to save you the time and effort it took me to build it.

## Documentation

The documentation is available on the [website](https://dirstarter.com/docs). It includes guides, tutorials, and detailed explanations of the code. I designed it to be as beginner-friendly as possible, so you can start making money from day one.
